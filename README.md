# Urban-Surveys
This code is compatible with MATLAB 2017b and designed to analyse in-situ measurement with Picarro G2301 in urban surveys. The code can be extended to read and analyse measurements from other instruments. For the first time, the code was applied in urban surveys of two European cities; Utrecht, NL and Hamburg, DE. An example of each day's surveys (including in-situ measurement using Picarro G2301 and GPS data files) is also provided along with the code from urban surveys in Hamburg, DE.
